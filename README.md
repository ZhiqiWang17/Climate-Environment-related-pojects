## Lnad climate dynamics
Investigate how the world would look if there could be no snow on vegetation.Through community land model CLM, visualize the effects of albedo, ground T and net primary production (NPP) by using in HPC. 
Concluded that the most dominant variable is albedo, especially in winter. Surface temperature is mainly affected by latitude and altitude.

## Rainfall prediction ma in R!
In this report, I tried the interpolation in R! instead of data processing in GIS. I load a set of data about precipitation and run it in R to create maps, then I used several 
methods to modify and interpolated the map, such as Thiessen polygons and IDW, incase to make my predictions for Texas rainfall more accurate step by step. Moreover, I will 
also modify the details of the map I obtained and gave the analyzation.

## Earth observation
Discover the link between land cover and the air quality concept will mainly be handled. QGIS 3.10 software is used for image classification, accuracy assessment and air quality analysis. Explore and preprocess Sentinel-2 satellite hyperspectral and multispectral data, and process stacked images.

## Land climae dynamics
Through community land model CLM, visualize the effects of albedo, ground T and net primary production (NPP) by using in HPC. concluded that the most dominant variable is albedo, especially in winter. Surface temperature is mainly affected by latitude and altitude.

## Sewer ystem in VUB
Create SWMM model of the sewer system in VUB campus, consider LID measures to solve the outflow problem. 
SWMM software allows the user to build models of sewer systems by implementing junctions, conduits, rain gages, sub-catchments. LID is Low Impact Developments, such as permeable pavement, green roofs, aim to decrease the stormwater runoff. 

## Surface water modeling
Surface water modeling using SWAT+ software.This project set up a hydrological model for the study area and investigate the effects on the performance of the model, The model has components such as weather, surface runoff, lateral flow, precipitation, evapotranspiration.
